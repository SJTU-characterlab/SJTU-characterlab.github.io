Augmented reality devices enable new approaches for character animation, e.g., given that character posing is three dimensional in nature it follows that interfaces with higher degrees-of-freedom (DoF) should outperform 2D interfaces. We present PoseMMR, allowing Multiple users to animate characters in a Mixed Reality environment, like how a stop-motion animator would manipulate a physical puppet, frame-by-frame, to create the scene. We explore the potential advantages of the PoseMMR can facilitate immersive posing, animation editing, version control and collaboration, and provide a set of guidelines to foster the development of immersive technologies as tools for collaborative authoring of character animation.
