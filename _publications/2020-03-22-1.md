Immersive technologies have increasingly attracted the attention of the computer animation community in search of more intuitive and effective alternatives to the current sophisticated 2D interfaces. The higher affordances offered by 3D interaction, as well as the enhanced spatial understanding have the potential to improve the animatorsâ€™ task, which is tremendously skill intensive and time-consuming. We explore the capabilities provided by our PoseMMR, multiple users posing and animating characters in a mixed reality (MR) environment, animation via group-based expert walkthroughs. We demonstrated our system can facilitate immersive posing, animation editing, version control and collaboration. We provide a set of guidelines and discussed the benefits and potential of immersive technologies for our future animation toolsets.
