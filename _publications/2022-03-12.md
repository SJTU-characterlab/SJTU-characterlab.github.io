Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive believable  stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining traditional blendshape animation techniques with machine learning models, we present a real time motion capture system, called MienCap, which drive character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way. We demon-strate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition of expressions depicted for animated characters via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be implemented into the VR filmmaking and animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.
