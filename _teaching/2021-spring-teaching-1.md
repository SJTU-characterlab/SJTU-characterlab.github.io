This course has the textbook and slides in English, taught in Chinese and English. Computer animation design is a major application of computer graphics. It has a wide range of applications in molecular modeling, medical imaging, earth science, space exploration, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis.

This course aims to introduce the basic concepts, theories, methods and systems of computer animation design and data visualization, and lay a good theoretical and practical foundation for virtual reality development and game development.

The main contents of this course include: Introduction to Computer Graphics, Rendering Pipeline and Technology, Mesh / Image / Point Cloud / Voxel Representation, Spatial Coordinates and Model View Transformation, Lighting Model, Texture and Texture Mapping, Shadow Generation, Ray Tracing, Curves and Surfaces, Optimization Methods, Virtual / Augmented Reality Introduction and Computer Animation Technology, etc.

Prerequisites: Linear Algebra, Advanced Mathematics, Algorithms, Data Structure, Probability Theory, etc.
